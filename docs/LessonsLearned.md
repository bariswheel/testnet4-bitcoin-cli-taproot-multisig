A running log of what I learned building a Taproot 2-of-3 multisig on Bitcoin Testnet4 using only bitcoin-cli. Written to be brutally practical, as opposed to fluffy.

‚∏ª

1) Environment, users, and permissions
	‚Ä¢	sudo -u bitcoin <cmd> runs one command as the bitcoin user, keeping my current shell.
	‚Ä¢	Use this when I only need a single privileged call, as opposed to switching shells.
	‚Ä¢	sudo -iu bitcoin starts an interactive login shell for the bitcoin user.
	‚Ä¢	New environment, new $HOME, new $PATH, new $BCLI. Ephemeral shell vars from my previous session won‚Äôt exist here unless exported, as opposed to staying in the same session.
	‚Ä¢	Shell var vs env var
	‚Ä¢	A1=... lives only in the current shell, not inherited by child processes.
	‚Ä¢	export BCLI=... becomes an environment variable; tools like jq, curl, or child shells see it, as opposed to shell-only variables.
	‚Ä¢	Cookie auth vs RPC password
	‚Ä¢	Running bitcoind creates testnet4/.cookie. bitcoin-cli reads it only if the calling user can read that file. If I run CLI as a different user, I‚Äôll see: ‚ÄúCould not locate RPC credentials‚Äù, as opposed to smooth auth.
	‚Ä¢	Fix: run CLI as the same user (bitcoin) or configure rpcuser/rpcpassword (less preferred).

‚∏ª

2) Networks and disk
	‚Ä¢	Testnet4 vs Testnet3
	‚Ä¢	Testnet4 uses prefix tb1p‚Ä¶ for Taproot and a different genesis. The data directory is .../testnet4/, as opposed to testnet3/. Mixing them creates weirdness (wrong ports, wrong cookie, wrong blocks).
	‚Ä¢	Pruning vs txindex
	‚Ä¢	Pruned nodes (prune=10000) keep a cap on block files (~10 GB). Great for Pi, as opposed to full archival.
	‚Ä¢	txindex=0 is required with pruning; txindex=1 on a tiny disk is pain. Decide upfront.
	‚Ä¢	dbcache
	‚Ä¢	More dbcache (e.g., 2048) speeds validation by caching UTXO set, as opposed to hammering the NVMe.

‚∏ª

3) Daemon hygiene and logs
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt Ctrl-C during IBD (initial block download). Use bitcoin-cli stop, as opposed to a hard kill.
	‚Ä¢	Systemd is your friend
	‚Ä¢	systemctl status -l bitcoind-testnet ‚Üí quick health
	‚Ä¢	journalctl -u bitcoind-testnet -f ‚Üí live logs (progress, peers, pruning)
	‚Ä¢	Space panics
	‚Ä¢	df -h /srv and du -h --max-depth=1 /srv find the hogs, as opposed to guessing.

‚∏ª

4) Descriptors and x-only keys ‚Äî the mental model
	‚Ä¢	Descriptors are ‚Äúhow to spend‚Äù strings, not keys. Example:

tr([5b4bd300/86h/1h/0h/0/0]03abcd...ef)#checksum

	‚Ä¢	tr(...) = Taproot policy
	‚Ä¢	[...] = origin + HD path
	‚Ä¢	03abcd... = 33-byte compressed pubkey (for info) which maps to a 32-byte x-only key under Taproot, as opposed to legacy P2PKH/P2WPKH semantics.

	‚Ä¢	X-only
	‚Ä¢	Taproot uses only the X coordinate (32 bytes). Y is implied: pick the even-Y solution, as opposed to storing a full 33-byte compressed key with a parity byte.
	‚Ä¢	getdescriptorinfo must add the checksum
	‚Ä¢	Importing raw descriptors will fail with ‚ÄúMissing checksum‚Äù, as opposed to succeeding. Always run:

DESC_CHK=$($BCLI getdescriptorinfo "$RAW" | jq -r .descriptor)



‚∏ª

5) Watch-only vs signer ‚Äî division of responsibility
	‚Ä¢	Watch-only wallet holds policy (descriptor) and tracks UTXOs, as opposed to holding keys.
	‚Ä¢	Signer wallet holds private keys and signs PSBTs, as opposed to merely watching.
	‚Ä¢	This split is intentional: safer mental model and a mirror of hardware-wallet workflows.

‚∏ª

6) PSBT pipeline ‚Äî what actually happens
	1.	Collect UTXO: listunspent ‚Üí get TXID, VOUT, AMT.
	2.	Build PSBT: walletcreatefundedpsbt (watch-only policy).
	3.	Sign PSBT: walletprocesspsbt (signer wallet) ‚Äî can be partial or complete, as opposed to raw hex signing.
	4.	Finalize: finalizepsbt ‚Üí outputs {hex, complete:true}.
	5.	Broadcast: sendrawtransaction HEX.
	6.	Verify: gettransaction TXID_CHILD + getbalances.

Why PSBT? It‚Äôs a portable transaction envelope ‚Äî ideal for multi-party or offline signing, as opposed to bespoke ad-hoc flows.

‚∏ª

7) Faucets and confirmations
	‚Ä¢	Faucets are rate-limited/unreliable. Some require GitHub login. That‚Äôs normal.
	‚Ä¢	Mempool vs Confirmed: untrusted_pending shows mempool; wait for confirmations > 0, as opposed to assuming instant settlement.

‚∏ª

8) Common errors I hit (and fixes)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúMissing checksum‚Äù ‚Üí run getdescriptorinfo and use .descriptor.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCould not locate RPC credentials‚Äù ‚Üí run CLI as bitcoin (cookie readable) or set RPC creds.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOnly legacy wallets supported by dumpwallet‚Äù ‚Üí descriptor wallets don‚Äôt dump legacy WIF; use getrawchangeaddress + getaddressinfo for descriptors, as opposed to dumping everything.
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúkey ‚Ä¶ is not valid‚Äù with tr(threshold(...)) ‚Üí Taproot doesn‚Äôt accept bare threshold(). Use multi_a or Miniscript sortedmulti_a, as opposed to pre-Taproot wsh(multi(...)).
	‚Ä¢	xxd: command not found ‚Üí install vim-common. xxd creates random internal x-only (/dev/urandom), as opposed to trying to hand-craft 32 bytes.

‚∏ª

9) Safety and repo hygiene
	‚Ä¢	Never commit wallet.dat or raw private keys, as opposed to showing off.
	‚Ä¢	.gitignore should ignore wallet.dat*, logs, temp files.
	‚Ä¢	Keep addresses, descriptors, TXIDs ‚Äî these are safe and educational.

‚∏ª

10) Why do this by hand?
	‚Ä¢	Doing it via CLI is muscle memory for how Bitcoin really works, as opposed to GUI magic.
	‚Ä¢	Once the internals are clear, moving to Sparrow/Electrum teaches how GUIs map to PSBT/descriptors.
	‚Ä¢	Hiring signal: shows you understand policy, construction, and validation, not just button-clicks.

‚∏ª

11) What I‚Äôd do differently next time
	‚Ä¢	Start on Testnet4 immediately; delete testnet3 early to save disk.
	‚Ä¢	Set prune=10000, dbcache=2048, maxconnections=32 up front.
	‚Ä¢	Put BCLI/MSCLI exports into ~/.bashrc for the bitcoin user to persist across SSH reconnects, as opposed to redefining them.
	‚Ä¢	Treat faucets as flaky; have 2‚Äì3 backups ready.
	‚Ä¢	Capture every command + output into /docs/walkthrough.md while I go.

‚∏ª

12) Quick glossary (opinionated)
	‚Ä¢	Descriptor: A ‚Äúhow to spend / how to derive‚Äù recipe (not a key).
	‚Ä¢	X-only: 32-byte pubkey (Taproot), even-Y convention, as opposed to 33-byte compressed.
	‚Ä¢	PSBT: Transaction envelope passed between policy and signer(s).
	‚Ä¢	Watch-only: Tracks UTXOs, no private keys, as opposed to signer.
	‚Ä¢	Signer: Holds keys and produces signatures, as opposed to only watching.
	‚Ä¢	Pruning: Keep recent blocks capped; saves disk, as opposed to full archival.
	‚Ä¢	dbcache: RAM for UTXO/DB caches; more RAM ‚Üí fewer disk hits.
	‚Ä¢	Cookie auth: Per-process token in .cookie, as opposed to static RPC passwords.

‚∏ª

13) Troubleshooting checklist (copy/paste friendly)
	‚Ä¢	systemctl status -l bitcoind-testnet
	‚Ä¢	journalctl -u bitcoind-testnet -f
	‚Ä¢	bitcoin-cli -datadir=... -conf=... -getinfo
	‚Ä¢	bitcoin-cli -datadir=... -conf=... getblockchaininfo | jq '.blocks,.headers'
	‚Ä¢	ls -la /srv/bitcoin-testnet/testnet4/.cookie (permissions)
	‚Ä¢	df -h /srv and du -h --max-depth=1 /srv (disk)
	‚Ä¢	grep -n '^chain=' /srv/bitcoin-testnet/bitcoin.conf (network)
	‚Ä¢	Re-derive descriptor checksum: getdescriptorinfo
	‚Ä¢	Verify wallet context: getwalletinfo (watch-only? private keys available?)

‚∏ª

14) Perspective: why Taproot 2-of-3?
	‚Ä¢	Privacy: Key-path spend looks like single-sig, as opposed to shouting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a multisig‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Flexibility: Script-path via Miniscript lets me encode more complex policies later (timelocks, recovery keys), as opposed to one rigid rule.
	‚Ä¢	Standards: PSBT + descriptors are the lingua franca across wallets.
